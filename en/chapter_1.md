Chapter I

An overview of our upcoming activities and preparations

The goal of this course is to provide an understanding of how to create a game project that can be completed by a novice solo developer with no previous experience.

If something is unclear, that's okay. Our brain is a biological computer that can physically change to absorb information and synthesize new knowledge. This process does not take much time. New synaptic connections are formed in the brain in 21 - 28 days. To make this process more successful, just eat healthy food, rich in proteins, carbohydrates and fiber - suppliers of energy and building materials for the brain, do exercises in the morning, breathe fresh air, and this is important, sleep. Sleep as much as your body requires. During sleep, the body does not idle. At this time, the brain organizes the information it received during wakefulness. It literally builds connections, growing synapses.

Later I will show you a game (Satori) that you can practice on your own to feel and sense how your brain analyzes and comprehends completely new information.

So what we will do in this course.

We will plan our project, create a fully completed prototype of the game, and then start creating it.

The point of this particular sequence of actions when creating a project is to do one thing at a time and clearly imagine the goal of your actions at the next stage. We achieve success when we understand the final goal, see a sample in front of us and understand where we can improve it.

For example, it is not difficult for you to make a paper airplane. You have probably made it many times. But remember when such an airplane first fell into your hands, how you took it apart and looked at the multiple folds on the paper. Remember your attempts to repeat the folding of the airplane, watching others and the moment when the airplane you created flew.

Why I am telling you this is that when you create your original game, you don't have someone else's airplane. No one has made your game before you. The most you can do now is watch someone make a hat, a box, or a boat out of paper, because no one has made an airplane before you.

Is this a reason for despair? Not at all. We know for sure that paper can be used to make different things and someone has already made the first box, hat and boat.

Now, if you are inspired enough, let's get to the preparation. If not, go and make a paper airplane.

We will start by creating an account in github or gitlab or another similar service, where our prototype and project files will be stored, as well as changes to them. Do it yourself. The git repository will be one of your main tools when creating the game.
